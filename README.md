# NJIT_API
***I) How an API for our school will be used to support the school’s business operations.***
	1) An API for our school is focusing on using application interface and it is a set of rules that allow all the programs to talk to each other within the NJIT business operations. For example, the NJIT pipeline contains many programs which support students to register their classes, make a payment, attend online class and even connect with third party online study module Canvas.
	This helps students and faculties access all the homework, assignments and etc… via cellphone (iOS, android..) 
	Specially, the scope of the project is to create a minimally viable product (MVP) of an API that supports online course registration for our school.

***II ) Describe the uses of API such as supporting mobile and web-based course registration. ***

For me, I believe the uses of API that support the mobile and web-based course registration should focus on the matrix of database where all the course which require should be highlighted. 
All the API owners should communicate with API administrators to make sure the API manager have all the accurate contents. That will help the API lifecycle will go smoothly. 
The API Gateway where all the company or organization use to put databases and payment system into it to put the signal on the program and services will return the client applications.
